Lab 9:

This is a log and will not be annotated as well as a regular lab.

Steps taken:

Step 1:
From our local computer:
ssh-keygen

Results:
"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/austinwang/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/austinwang/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/austinwang/.ssh/id_rsa.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:HRzhsQkjmC9/+8xnaU6+v/7Wb/HR/iRT6MpphOF+5g4 austinxwang@s-164-67-124-200
The key's randomart image is:
***REDACTED for safety purposes***
"

Step 2:
ssh-copy-id -i austinx@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

Results:
"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/Users/austinwang/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
austinx@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'austinx@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
"

Step 3:
ssh-add

Results:
"
Identity added: /Users/austinwang/.ssh/id_rsa (austinwang@Austins-MacBook-Pro.local)
"

Step 4 (quick test):
ssh austinx@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

Result:
Successfully log in without prompting password


Step 5 Port Forwarding:
From local computer:
ssh -X austinx@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

Result:
logged in successfully without prompting password

Step 6:
xeyes

Result:
opens up a pair of eyeballs that track my mouse movement.

Step 7 daisy chain:
ssh -A -t austinx@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A -t austinx@lnxsrv08.seas.ucla.edu

*Note I used srv9 and 8 for the daisy chain example instead of 7 to 9, for the sake of
consistency. (I started the process with lnxsrv09)

Result:
Successfully connects to lnxsrv08 with no password prompt

when I Control-D:
"Goodbye.
Connection to lnxsrv08.seas.ucla.edu closed.
Connection to lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu closed.
